# Luniverse Gluwacoin

Implementation of Sidechain Gluwacoin for [Luniverse](https://luniverse.io/)

Read [Sidechain Gluwacoin](Sidechain%20Gluwacoin.md) for details.

## What is Gluwacoin?

Gluwacoin is an interoperable stablecoin standard. The standard has built-in functions to enable exchange with other cryptocurrencies, which connects its ecosystem to other blockchains. We have implemented the system to support the ERC20 standard on the Ethereum network. The implementation includes security features, compliance features, and upgrade features that provide the desired level of security and elasticity.

The Gluwacoin Trust proposed the standard. This repository is the official implementations of the Gluwacoin standard by Gluwa.
